# CQELight

CQELight is a DDD, Command Query & Event Sourcing extensible and customisable base framework

CQELight allows you to do clean loosely coupled architecture for your software developpments.

Based on Domain Driven Design, you can create your objects within boundaries, as aggregates, entities or value objects.
With this clean object architecture, you can perform simple, flexible and extensible CQRS operations for interact with the system.

CQELight is also fully extensible the way you want. We provide a basic implementation with :

 - Entity Framework Core as ORM (https://github.com/aspnet/entityframework/)
 - Autofac as IoC container (https://github.com/autofac/Autofac/)
 - NewtonSoft as Json Serializer (https://github.com/JamesNK/Newtonsoft.Json/)
 
 You can have your own, and overwrite ours as you wish.
